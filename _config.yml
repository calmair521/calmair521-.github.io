  During my spare time, I have a lot of hobbies. First of all, I'm big fan of NBA and Kobe Bryant is my favourite player. 
  I like playing basketball, tennis, golf and other sports. In addition, I like playing guitar, which I think is a good way 
  to have a relax. I'm an easy-going and open minded person. I'm happy to make friends with different people and to offer help.
